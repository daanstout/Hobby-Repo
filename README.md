# Hobby-Repo
A Repo for different little programs

This is where i put most of my hobby-projects. These projects differ in many different states of completion, where some are barely started, and some are near completed

Status:

(near-)Completed:  
<b>Brainfuck Interpreter (Completed)</b> - A working brainfuck interpreter that works in the Console  
<b>Circle practice (Completed)</b> - I used this to get a feel for working with the Sine and Cosine functions when working with circles  
<b>Common Ancestor (Completed)</b> - Based on the Common Ancestor Numberphile video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm0hOex4psA&t=1s  
<b>GeneticHumans (Near-Completed)</b> - My attempt at genetic algorithms. This is console based and allows you to create a human population and see how their genes evolve over time, last I worked on it, was in the middle of a partial rewrite of the controls parsing  
<b>Resource Gatherer</b> - A simple C# program I made. In it, there is a field with divided into four by rivers, with resources spread randomly, and two gatherers who look for, and gather the resources into a shed in the middle. Fully written in WinForms C#, with some help from Buckland Coding by Example.  
<b>Word Counter</b> - A simple project that takes in a .txt file and outputs a .txt file showing what words occur in it, and how often.  


Half-Completed:  


Started but not very far:  
<b>CHIP-8 Interpreter (Rough state)</b> - I decided to dabble in emulators, and started with this one. Never got very far, but I used the knowledge gained from it when developing my Brainfuck Interpreter  
<b>Circuit Builder (Rough state)</b> - I thought it would be fun to create an application in which you can create logic circuits, but I didn't get very far in it, as I lost interest  
<b>Resource Gatherer Mono</b> - An attempt at porting Resource Gatherer to use MonoCode, but lost interest in the project along the way.
<b>Tower Defense</b> - An idea by a friend of mine that I thought was interesting. A tower defense game where, instead of following a path, you can place turrets anywhere, as long as there is a path to the end. Though I did not get very far.
<b>Visual Brainfuck Interpreter</b> - A visual Brainfuck Interpreter, showing you what part the interpreter is currently executing, and the status of all the cells (what value they store). It has a slightly adjusted version of the Brainfuck Interpreter, that better fits this project.  


Programmed A-long, but is close or equal to the source, used mainly in learning (Note that I did not make these myself, but followed along in order to learn):  
<b>ConFPS</b> - Coded along with the One-Lone Coder youtube channel  
<b>GameEngine</b> - A C++ GameEngine using DirectX that I followed along with the PardCode tutorial on Youtube  
<b>Perlin Noise Demo</b> - A Perlin Noise Demo I followed along with the One-Lone Coder youtube channel  
<b>olConsoleGameEngine</b> - A C++ console game engine made by the One-Lone Coder youtube channel
