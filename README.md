# Hobby-Repo
A Repo for different little programs

This is where i put most of my hobby-projects. These projects differ in many different states of completion, where some are barely started, and some are near completed

Status:

(near-)Completed:  
<b>Brainfuck Interpreter (Completed)</b> - A working brainfuck interpreter that works in the Console  
<b>Circle practice (Completed)</b> - I used this to get a feel for working with the Sine and Cosine functions when working with circles  
<b>Common Ancestor (Completed)</b> - Based on the Common Ancestor Numberphile video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm0hOex4psA&t=1s  
<b>GeneticHumans (Near-Completed)</b> - My attempt at genetic algorithms. This is console based and allows you to create a human population and see how their genes evolve over time, last I worked on it, was in the middle of a partial rewrite of the controls parsing  

Half-Completed:  


Started but not very far:  
<b>CHIP-8 Interpreter (Rough state)</b> - I decided to dabble in emulators, and started with this one. Never got very far, but I used the knowledge gained from it when developing my Brainfuck Interpreter  
<b>Circuit Builder (Rough state)</b> - I thought it would be fun to create an application in which you can create logic circuits, but I didn't get very far in it, as I lost interest  


Programmed A-long, but is close or equal to the source, used mainly in learning:  
<b>ConFPS</b> - Coded along with the One-Lone Coder youtube channel  
<b>GameEngine</b> - A C++ GameEngine using DirectX that I followed along with the PardCode tutorial on Youtube
